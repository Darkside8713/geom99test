                    <h1>Welcome to Development Activity Tracker!</h1>
                    <p>City development is a dynamic process which plays an important role on sustainable growth of modern cities. As Toronto is the largest city in Canada, the amount of development activity within the city is extremely high. There were 76,358 development applications received by the City of Toronto between January 1, 2008 to April 6, 2022. The high amount of development activity can be daunting if people were to look for developments in a certain area without a map. Thus, the City of Toronto is interested in being able to map all the development activities, allowing the public to access detailed information of development applications interactively.</p>
                    <p>To help alleviating the difficulties when researching development activities, Fleming Flamingos has explored and ultilized various Esri web technology to deliver a series of web solutions. Our journey from start from finish is documented in this website.</p>
